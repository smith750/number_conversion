# Amount Conversion
This program takes numbers such as "2523.40" and converts them to spelled out English strings, such as "Two thousand twenty-three and 40/100".

To run:
ruby amount_converter.rb

If a command line argument is added, that will be parsed and the result for that will be printed out.  Otherwise, the program will enter an interactive loop and will convert amounts given through the interaction.
